        <h2 class="h5">Introduction / Social Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          Laser cutting is widely used in modern manufacturing for metals, textiles, and other materials, and its economic
          value depends heavily on how efficiently the tool path is planned across hundreds of parts on a sheet.
          The path planning problem is NP-hard and further complicated by real production constraints such as contour
          nesting (inner holes must be cut before outer profiles) and priority rules imposed for quality and scheduling.
          Traditional heuristic algorithms like simulated annealing or genetic algorithms can provide good solutions, but
          they become slow or unstable when the number of contours exceeds 100, which is common in industrial drawings.
          This motivates the use of AI-based methods that can reuse learned structure to deliver near–optimal paths
          much faster, while still respecting engineering constraints such as nesting and priority ordering.

        <h2 class="h5">System Design & Methods</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Formulated laser cutting tool-path planning as a constrained optimization problem with nesting
            and priority constraints; discretized each contour into point sets and modeled the problem as a
            Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (GTSP).
          </li>
          <li>
            Simplified GTSP instances into classical TSP by pre-selecting entry/exit points using geometric
            center–based strategies, and unified all instances into an adjacency-matrix format suitable for
            large-scale batch solving and learning.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implemented and compared several mature heuristic baselines (Simulated Annealing, Tabu Search,
            Ant Colony Optimization, Genetic Algorithms) to understand their runtime and solution-quality
            behavior on large GTSP/TSP instances.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed a Deep Reinforcement Learning model with heterogeneous and sparse attention to construct
            TSP tours; trained it on a large corpus of randomly generated TSP instances from a custom problem
            generator.
          </li>
          <li>
            Evaluated the trained DRL policy against state-of-the-art solvers such as LKH-3 and Nearest Neighbor,
            then mapped TSP solutions back to feasible cutting paths that satisfy nesting and priority constraints
            on real industrial laser-cutting drawings.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h5">Results / Evaluation</h2>
        <p>
          Experiments on large synthetic TSP benchmarks and real laser-cutting drawings show that the proposed
          DRL model can solve most instances two orders of magnitude faster than traditional heuristic methods,
          while keeping tour length within about 10% of LKH-3 for many cases with priority constraints.
          For GTSP problems exceeding 100 nodes, classical heuristics often require several minutes of runtime
          or even cause kernel crashes, whereas the trained policy maintains stable inference time on the same
          scale of problems. The GTSP–to–TSP conversion pipeline was validated to be unbiased using enumeration
          and simulated annealing on smaller instances, confirming that solutions in the transformed space can be
          reliably mapped back to valid cutting paths. Some specific contour distributions still lead to degraded
          solution quality, highlighting directions for future model refinement and constraint-aware training.

          <li>
            Implemented and tuned multiple heuristic baselines, then designed experiments to compare their
            runtime and solution quality on large-scale GTSP/TSP problems.

          <li>
            Implemented the heterogeneous-attention DRL model and custom TSP instance generator in Python/PyTorch,
            conducted large-scale training, and integrated the model into the end-to-end solving pipeline.

          <li>
            Applied the trained solver to real laser-cutting drawings provided by industry partners, analyzed
            failure cases for difficult contour patterns, and wrote the full bachelor thesis documenting the
            methodology and results.
