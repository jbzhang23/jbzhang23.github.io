            I am a graduate student in Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, focusing on
            robotics and control. I enjoy working at the intersection of modeling, estimation, and real-time
            control, where theory has to survive noisy sensors, hardware limits, and tight deadlines.

                Visual: map + trajectory plot showing EKF-SLAM localization and LQR-controlled path tracking.
              </div>

              <p><strong>Introduction / Problem.</strong> The goal of this course project was to enable an autonomous ground
                vehicle to track a reference path in an urban-like environment using noisy sensor data. Reliable
                localization and robust lateral control are critical for reducing accidents and improving traffic efficiency
                as autonomous vehicles become more common.</p>

              <p><strong>Method / Design.</strong> I modeled the vehicle using a nonlinear bicycle model and implemented an
                Extended Kalman Filter that fused wheel odometry, IMU, and range measurements into a consistent state
                estimate. On top of the linearized dynamics, I designed an LQR controller for lateral and heading tracking
                and integrated a graph-based SLAM module so that the controller could operate in a partially unknown map.
              </p>

              <p><strong>Results / Evaluation.</strong> In simulation, the controller achieved stable tracking with a lateral
                error under 0.15&nbsp;m RMS on curved roads and recovered gracefully from injected sensor noise and
                small disturbances. Compared to a baseline PID controller, the LQR design reduced overshoot and
                improved settling time, especially when the map was updated online via SLAM.</p>

              <p><strong>My Contribution / Role.</strong> I implemented the full estimation–control pipeline, including the
                EKF derivation, discrete-time LQR design, and ROS-based integration. I also generated the evaluation
                metrics and plots used to compare different controller tunings.</p>

              </div>

              <p><strong>Introduction / Social Value.</strong> During severe epidemics, front-line logistics workers face high
                exposure risk. Our project proposed a contactless logistics platform that allows an operator to remotely
                drive a small electric vehicle to deliver goods in hospitals or quarantine zones, reducing unnecessary
                person-to-person contact.</p>

              <p><strong>Design / Method.</strong> We built a ROS-based teleoperation system that streamed multi-view camera
                feeds and LiDAR data to the operator, overlaid predicted trajectories, and provided a visual assistance HUD.
                A joystick interface translated the operator's commands into low-level motor and steering signals, while
                safety modules enforced speed limits and soft geofencing.</p>

              <p><strong>Results / Evaluation.</strong> In field tests on a mock hospital corridor, the platform completed
                delivery routes with centimeter-level tracking accuracy and maintained stable video and control latency
                within 150&nbsp;ms. The system was recognized at a national-level innovation competition for its potential
                to support safe logistics in public health emergencies.</p>

              <p><strong>My Contribution / Role.</strong> As team lead, I coordinated system architecture, implemented the
                ROS nodes for trajectory prediction overlay, and handled integration between the vehicle's embedded
                controller and the remote user interface. I also led the testing protocol and documented the performance
                metrics.</p>

                Visual: sequence of frames or phase plot showing quadruped transitioning from trot to bound without loss of stability.
              </div>

              <p><strong>Problem / Motivation.</strong> Legged robots often need to switch between different gaits (for example,
                from a slow walk to a faster trot) when terrain or speed requirements change. Abrupt transitions can lead to
                loss of balance or large tracking errors. The goal of this project was to design a controller that produces
                smooth, dynamically consistent gait transitions.</p>

              <p><strong>Idea & Design.</strong> I combined model-based optimal control with reinforcement learning. First,
                I used trajectory optimization to generate reference motions that satisfied the robot's dynamic constraints.
                Then, I trained a policy that learned to track these references and interpolate between them, using a reward
                that balanced tracking accuracy, energy efficiency, and foot-slip penalties.</p>

              <p><strong>Evidence / Results.</strong> In simulation, the controller achieved smooth transitions between walking,
                trotting, and bounding at different speeds, with reduced body pitching and improved foot clearance compared to
                a purely heuristic state machine. The learned policy generalized to moderate modeling errors and small terrain
                irregularities without re-tuning.</p>

              <p><strong>Contribution / Role.</strong> I implemented the dynamics interface, designed the reward function, and
                evaluated performance using center-of-mass tracking error and contact consistency metrics. I also generated
                visualizations and videos to analyze how the learned policy blended between optimized gait primitives.</p>

                Visual: photo or CAD rendering of the suspension test rig with pneumatic artificial muscles and sensors.
              </div>

              <p><strong>Introduction / Objective.</strong> Traditional passive suspensions have limited ability to adapt to
                different road conditions or payloads. This project explored a flexible suspension concept using pneumatic
                artificial muscles (PAMs) as tunable, compliant actuators to improve ride comfort and vibration isolation.</p>

              <p><strong>Design / Method.</strong> I modeled the quarter-car dynamics with PAM elements and designed a feedback
                controller that adjusted chamber pressure based on measured acceleration and displacement. The prototype
                included pressure regulators, displacement sensors, and an embedded controller that executed the control law
                in real time.</p>

              <p><strong>Results / Evaluation.</strong> Bench-top experiments with sinusoidal and step-like road profiles showed
                a noticeable reduction in transmitted acceleration compared to a baseline passive spring-damper system. The
                system could trade off stiffness and comfort by changing the pressure set-points, demonstrating the potential
                of PAM-based suspensions for small vehicles or assistive devices.</p>

              <p><strong>My Contribution / Role.</strong> I led the modeling and control design, implemented the real-time
                controller, and performed system identification to obtain PAM stiffness curves. I also designed plots and
                frequency-response visualizations to communicate the performance improvements.</p>
