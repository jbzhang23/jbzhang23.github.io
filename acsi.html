        <h2 class="h5">Introduction / Social Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          Autonomous recovery of UAVs onto moving ground vehicles would enable persistent inspection, 
          mobile sensing, and flexible delivery without needing fixed infrastructure. This is especially 
          valuable in scenarios where deploying large ground stations is impractical or where vehicles must 
          operate over long distances. However, performing dynamic landing on a small, resource-limited 
          quadrotor like the Crazyflie is challenging: the platform has tight thrust margins, is sensitive 
          to payload changes, and depends on external localization and a wireless link. Real-world issues 
          such as localization noise, communication delay, and unpredictable vehicle motion motivate a control 
          framework that is both safety-aware and deployable on modest hardware.

        <ul>
          <li>Built AutoReFly, a Crazyflie-based system integrating nonlinear MPC (NMPC) for tracking, obstacle avoidance, payload transport, and dynamic landing.</li>
          <li>
            Modeled the UAV as a 13-state rigid body and formulated the NMPC problem in CasADi with constraints for thrust, orientation, and collision avoidance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Evaluated three control abstraction levels—low-level wrench control, high-level position control, and mid-level velocity-tracking—to determine a hardware-feasible interface.
          </li>
          <li>
            Selected velocity-command NMPC to handle communication delay, radio jitter, and Crazyflie thrust limitations.
          </li>
          <li>
            Integrated Lighthouse localization, Ranger Deck sensing, and a moving UGV carrying a “dead drone” as the landing target.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="h5">Results / Evaluation</h2>
        <p>
          In simulation, the full rigid-body NMPC produced realistic tracking and landing behaviors, 
          but we found that low-level force/torque commands were highly sensitive to realistic communication delays, 
          making them unsuitable for deployment on the Crazyflie. This motivated the shift to a velocity-command 
          NMPC interface. On hardware, we systematically validated each sensing and actuation component: 
          Lighthouse localization provided stable 3D pose at around 50 Hz for both UAV and moving platform; 
          the Ranger Deck reliably triggered collision-avoidance motions while maintaining altitude; 
          and IMU-based stabilization kept the Crazyflie hovering robustly even under small disturbances. 
          These experiments confirmed that the sensing stack and control abstraction are adequate foundations for future full autonomous recovery demonstrations.
        </p>

          The project was recognized as "The Best Project" of Fall 2025 at the Mechancial Engineering department, CMU.
