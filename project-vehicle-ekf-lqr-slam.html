        <h2 class="h5">Introduction / Problem</h2>
        <p>
          This project focused on enabling an autonomous ground vehicle to track a reference path
          in an urban-like environment using noisy sensor data. Reliable localization and robust
          lateral control are critical for safety and traffic efficiency as autonomous vehicles
          become more common in real-world scenarios.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h5">Methods</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Modeled the vehicle using a nonlinear bicycle model and linearized it around operating points.</li>
          <li>Implemented an Extended Kalman Filter to fuse wheel odometry, IMU, and range sensor measurements.</li>
          <li>Designed a discrete-time LQR controller for lateral and heading tracking based on the linearized dynamics.</li>
          <li>Integrated a SLAM back-end so that the controller could operate with an evolving map.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h5">Results</h2>
        <p>
          The closed-loop system achieved stable path tracking with lateral error under 0.15&nbsp;m RMS
          on curved segments, even with injected sensor noise and small disturbances. Compared to a tuned
          PID baseline, the LQR controller reduced overshoot and improved settling time. The EKF-SLAM
          pipeline maintained consistent pose estimates, which was essential for the controller’s performance.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h5">My Contribution</h2>
        <p>
          I implemented the full estimation–control pipeline, including EKF derivation, LQR design,
          and ROS-based integration. I also designed experiments and evaluation metrics, and produced
          trajectory and error plots to compare different controller tunings.
