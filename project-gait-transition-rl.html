        <h2 class="h5">Problem / Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          Quadruped robots often need to switch between different gaits (walk, trot, bound) to adapt to
          varying terrain and speed requirements. Traditional gait scheduling using heuristic state
          machines can produce abrupt transitions, leading to poor tracking, high energy consumption,
          or even loss of balance. This project aimed to design a controller that produces smooth,
          dynamically consistent gait transitions while maintaining robustness to modeling errors.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h5">Idea & Methodology</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Used model-based trajectory optimization to generate feasible gait patterns (e.g., walking,
            trotting) that satisfy the robot’s dynamics and contact constraints.
          </li>
          <li>
            Represented each gait as a motion primitive and designed a parameterization that allows
            continuous interpolation between primitives in the state space.
          </li>
          <li>
            Trained a reinforcement learning policy to track these references while minimizing tracking
            error, control effort, and foot slip, using domain randomization to improve robustness.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implemented a transition scheduler that selects and blends motion primitives based on
            desired speed and terrain context.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h5">Results / Evidence</h2>
        <p>
          In simulation, the combined optimal control and RL controller produced noticeably smoother
          transitions between walking, trotting, and faster gaits compared to a fixed, heuristic
          state machine. Center-of-mass tracking error and body pitch oscillations were reduced
          during transitions, and ground reaction forces remained within reasonable bounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          The learned policy generalized to moderate variations in mass distribution and small height
          changes in the terrain without re-tuning, suggesting that the approach is promising for
          sim-to-real transfer on physical quadruped platforms.

        <h2 class="h5">My Contribution</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Implemented the dynamics interface between the quadruped model and the trajectory optimizer / RL
            environment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed the reward function to trade off tracking accuracy, energy usage, and contact stability.
          </li>
          <li>
            Conducted ablation studies comparing pure RL, pure trajectory tracking, and the combined approach.
          </li>
          <li>
            Generated visualizations (phase plots, body motion snapshots, contact sequences) to analyze how
            the controller blended different gait primitives over time.
          </li>
