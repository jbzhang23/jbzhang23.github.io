        <h2 class="h5">Introduction / Social Motivation</h2>
        <p>
          During severe epidemic outbreaks, logistics workers who deliver medical supplies, food, and
          equipment to high-risk areas face significant exposure. Our project proposed a contactless
          logistics platform in which an operator remotely drives a small electric vehicle through
          hospital corridors or quarantine zones, reducing unnecessary person-to-person contact while
          maintaining reliable delivery service.
        </p>

      <section class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h5">System Design & Methods</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Built a ROS-based teleoperation architecture connecting on-vehicle sensors (cameras, LiDAR)
            with a remote operator station over a wireless network.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implemented a visual assistance interface that fused multi-view camera feeds with predicted
            trajectories and key overlays (e.g., distance to obstacles, corridor boundaries).
          </li>
          <li>
            Mapped joystick inputs from the operator to low-level motor and steering commands, including
            smooth acceleration/braking profiles.
          </li>
          <li>
            Added safety layers such as soft geofencing, maximum speed enforcement, and a software
            emergency stop.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h5">Results / Evaluation</h2>
        <p>
          We evaluated the platform in a mock hospital corridor with narrow passages and multiple turns.
          The system maintained end-to-end control latency within approximately 150&nbsp;ms while
          streaming live video and sensor data. Remote operators were able to complete delivery routes
          with centimeter-level tracking accuracy and no collisions, even under limited visibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project was recognized at a national-level innovation competition for its potential to
          support safer logistics workflows in future public health emergencies.

      <section class="mb-4">
        <h2 class="h5">My Contribution</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Led the overall system architecture and task planning as team leader.</li>
          <li>
            Implemented ROS nodes for trajectory prediction visualization and sensor fusion on the
            operator interface.
          </li>
          <li>
            Integrated the onboard embedded controller with the remote control station and tuned
            the control command mapping for smooth teleoperation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed and executed test scenarios, collected performance metrics, and prepared the
            technical documentation and presentation materials.
