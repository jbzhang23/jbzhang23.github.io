        <p>
          Conventional passive suspensions offer limited adaptability to different road conditions,
          payloads, or comfort requirements. This project explored a flexible suspension concept using
          pneumatic artificial muscles (PAMs) as tunable, compliant actuators. The goal was to reduce
          transmitted vibration and improve ride comfort while demonstrating how smart actuation can
          shape the dynamic behavior of a small-scale suspension system.

        <h2 class="h5">System Modeling & Design</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Developed a quarter-car model with PAM elements replacing or augmenting the traditional
            spring–damper pair.
          </li>
          <li>
            Performed system identification experiments to estimate PAM stiffness characteristics as a
            function of internal pressure and displacement.
          </li>
          <li>
            Designed a feedback controller that adjusted chamber pressure based on measured acceleration
            and displacement, targeting reduced transmissibility in the frequency range of interest.
          </li>
          <li>
            Implemented the control law on an embedded controller interfaced with pressure regulators
            and sensors in real time.

        <h2 class="h5">Experimental Results</h2>
        <p>
          The prototype suspension was tested on a bench-top rig under sinusoidal and step-like
          excitation profiles. Compared to a baseline passive configuration, the PAM-based system
          showed a noticeable reduction in peak acceleration transmitted to the “body” mass.
        </p>
        <p>
          By changing PAM pressure set-points, the effective stiffness of the suspension could be
          tuned, demonstrating a trade-off between comfort and support. Frequency-response plots
          showed a shift in resonance behavior consistent with the identified parameters.
